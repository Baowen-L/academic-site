My PhD dissertation investigates the relationship between the Confucian culture and citizens' political attitudes and behaviors in East Asia. This dissertation is composed of three distinct empirical chapters. Each examines a specific domain where culture may exert its influence. Chapter 1 draws on the World Values Survey and the Asian Barometer Survey to study the impact of individualism-collectivism on negativity biases in authority evaluations. Chapter 2 uses an online experiment in China to investigate the effect of individualism-collectivism on negativity biases in generalized trust. Chapter 3 uses data from historical archives and the China General Social Survey and explores the correlation between meritocracy and gender gaps in Chinese village elections. <br/>

**Chapter 1**: The Relevance of Culture: Collectivism Reduces Negativity Biases in Government Evaluation <br/>

<details>
In political science, there is a broad literature that investigates the negativity biases in citizens’ attitudes and behaviors. In particular, we know that citizens’ political evaluations tend to be more strongly influenced by negative than positive perceptions of traits, events and policy outcomes. In this paper, I argue that culture is a significant yet understudied correlate of negativity biases. A multilevel analysis using the World Values Survey (WVS) demonstrates that the negativity bias in national government satisfaction weakens as a society’s level of collectivism rises. Next, I explore the effect of cultural values at the individual level with data from the Asian Barometer Survey (ABS). In line with the results from the WVS, I find that collectivism reduces the negative-positive asymmetry when citizens evaluate the incumbent authority on the basis of government performance. These results invite more caution when taking negativity biases as a general pattern that describes citizens’ attitudes toward political authority everywhere.

**Chapter 2**: Is Bad Always Stronger than Good? Culture and Negativity Biases in Generalized Trust  <br/>

<details>
Generalized trust refers to the trust that individuals have in the members of society. Social research identifies several psychological barriers that hinder trust development, including negativity biases. Previous studies demonstrate that trust is relatively easy to destroy but challenging to create. However, current research on negativity biases heavily relies on geographically-constrained samples from the Western hemisphere. In this paper, I argue that the negativity bias literature is based on individualistic assumptions and overlooks collectivistic contexts. Using a preregistered online experiment conducted in China, I find that receiving negative information about the untrustworthiness of other social members has a more profound impact on generalized trust than receiving comparable positive information about their trustworthiness. Nevertheless, the asymmetric effect of information on trust is contingent on participants’ self-rated cultural values. Individuals with higher collectivistic values tend to exhibit less negativity bias in trust development. These results shed light on the role of culture in understanding the dynamics of trust formation and call for further exploration of cultural influences on negativity biases.

 **Chapter 3**: Cultural Sources of Gender Gaps: Confucian Meritocracy Reduces Gender Inequalities in Political Participation <br/>

<details>
The historical oppression of women in China mirrors the experiences of women in many other cultures. During the imperial era, Confucian ideologies and institutions played a significant role in perpetuating women’s disenfranchisement. This perception has become deeply entrenched, to the extent that contemporary discussions on women’s status often automatically refer to lingering Confucian legacies as one of the obstacles to achieving gender equality. However, this study offers a nuanced perspective by shedding light on how certain aspects of Confucianism, notably meritocracy, may serve to empower modern-day women. The research focuses on the Chinese context, particularly the historically significant Confucian-based meritocratic institution known as the civil examination system (keju). I argue that historical meritocratic legacies can have a lasting impact on contemporary behavior, specifically by reducing the gender gap in political participation in local village elections. Using data from historical archives and the China General Social Survey, I find a negative correlation between a prefecture’s historical success in the keju exams and the gender gap in village election turnout among present-day respondents.
