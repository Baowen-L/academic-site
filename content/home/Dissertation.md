In my dissertation I investigate how everyday life experiences of economic inequality influence citizens’ political attitudes. Specifically, I argue that individuals use their economic environment to compare themselves to their neighbours or peers and adjust their political views and behaviour accordingly. 


**Chapter 1**: Beyond the neighbourhood, but not too far: reconsidering the effect of the immediate environment
on citizens’ perceptions of the economy <br/>

<details>
 A growing number of studies investigate the role of local factors on individuals' political stances. Some of those studies showed that individuals use local economic conditions to infer the state of the national economy. What remains unknown is the extent to which individual mobility mitigates the impact of the local economic conditions on the perception of the national economy. The aim of this study is to demonstrate that when considering the impact of the local economic context on the perception of the national economy, it is necessary to take into account the mobility between the two places where citizens tend to spend most of their time: home and work. To do so, I use large administrative data from the US census bureau tapping the origin (residential area) and destination (workplace) of citizens and surveys on political preferences retrieved from the Cooperative Congressional Election Survey to measure the perception of the national economy. By means of this study, I aim to contribute to the literature on local politics and economic voting by giving a more complete picture of the context in which an individual lives and the effect of this specific environment on economic perception. <br/>

 **Chapter 3**: Housing Prices as a Reminder of Inequality: Evidence from a Survey Experiment <br/>

<details>
Do changes in housing prices influence political behaviour? Recent research that links houses prices and electoral outcomes suggest they do. However, the
literature on the political consequences of housing prices often takes for granted that individuals follow the market and re-evaluate their economic standing accordingly. The aim of this research note is to test this assumption and examine whether residents react to housing market information provided to them. The goal is to assess whether exposure to information on the housing market in their locality leads individuals to adjust their perceptions of their economic standing as well as their financial capacity. By means of two experiments conducted in Canada and the United States using real-world data on housing prices, I show that informing respondents of current housing prices triggers the feeling of economic downgrading among tenants. This information also affects their perceived financial capacity to move elsewhere and their fear of being priced out. The results highlight the effective influence of housing prices on perceived economic standing. It has important implications for our understanding of the political consequences of housing prices, especially with regard to the economic anxiety it may generate and for whom.

 **Chapter 4**: Does Compositional Stability Foster Electoral Contibuity? <br/>
<details>
Empirical research provides evidence that elected officials benefit from the so-called incumbency advantage. Compositional stability of a city could be an important factor of electoral stability.  Testing this argument, however, is challenging due to the endogenous nature of social composition of a city and candidate turnover. To avoid this empirical problem, I leverage an exogenous spatial variation in the implementation of social housing policies in France. The SRU law substantially changed the conditions of housing development in France by forcing some mayors to alter the socio-economic composition of their city. With this study, I aim to advance our understating of the role of compositional change in an incumbent's electoral fortunes as well as the conditions under which local residents are more likely to accept more social housing in their city.
