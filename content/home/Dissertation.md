My PhD project investigates the cultural relevance for negativity biases in politics. My main argument is that collectivistic contexts should reduce negativity biases. I conceive three empirical chapters. Chapter 1 draws on the World Values Survey and the Asian Barometer Survey to study the cultural impact on negativity biases in authority evaluations. Chapter 2 uses an online experiment in China to investigate the cultural effect on negativity biases in generalized trust. Chapter 3 adopts physiological measures and explores the relationship between cultural values and psychophysiological reactions to positive and negative stimuli in a laboratory setting. <br/>

**Chapter 1**: The Relevance of Culture: Collectivism Reduces Negativity Biases in Government Evaluation <br/>

<details>
In political science, there is a broad literature that investigates the negativity biases in citizens’ attitudes and behaviors. In particular, we know that citizens’ political evaluations tend to be more strongly influenced by negative than positive perceptions of traits, events and policy outcomes. In this paper, I argue that culture is a significant yet understudied correlate of negativity biases. Multilevel analysis using the World Values Survey (WVS) demonstrates that the negativity bias in national government satisfaction weakens as a society’s level of collectivism rises. Next, I explore the effect of cultural values at the individual level with data from the Asian Barometer Survey (ABS). In line with the results from the WVS, I find that collectivism reduces the negative-positive asymmetry when citizens evaluate the incumbent authority on the basis of government performance. These results invite more caution when taking negativity biases as a general pattern that describes citizens’ attitudes toward political authority everywhere.

**Chapter 2**: Is Bad Always Stronger than Good? Culture and Negativity Biases in Generalized Trust  <br/>

<details>
Generalized trust, also known as social trust or interpersonal trust, designates the trust that people have in the fellow members of society in general. Social research identifies a few psychological barriers that impair the development of trust, among which the negativity biases. Previous work convincingly illustrates that trust is relatively easy to destroy and difficult to create. However, current research on negativity biases relies heavily on geographically-constrained samples from the Western hemisphere. In this paper, I argue that the negativity bias in forming generalized trust is based on contingent individualistic assumptions. There is a lack of attention for collectivistic contexts. Using an online experiment conducted with 2000 respondents from China, I find that, in line with the negativity bias account, receiving (negative) information about other social members’ untrustworthiness has a stronger impact on generalized trust than receiving comparable (positive) information about trustworthiness. However, information’s asymmetric effect on trust is conditional on participants’ self-rated cultural values. Individuals who have higher collectivistic values tend to exhibit less negativity bias in forming trust.

 **Chapter 3**: Negativity Biases and Culture: Physiological Reactions of Bicultural Individuals (collaboration with Patrick Fournier and Stuart Soroka) <br/>

<details>
There is a broad literature identifying a negativity bias in humans’ attentiveness and decision-making. Previous research has found individual-level correlates with negativity biases, including as gender, personality and political ideology. In this paper, we argue that culture is a significant yet understudied explanatory factor of negativity biases. We expect collectivistic culture to reduce negativity biases, at least in some domains, because collectivistic norms prioritize social connectedness over individual achievements. Too much negativity may produce counter effects by jeopardizing group harmony. As a result, negativity biases have decreased “adaptive value” for people in collectivistic societies. <br/>
To test this hypothesis, we conduct a laboratory experiment. We recruit 200 bicultural Chinese in Canada and the US. Drawing on the culture-as-situated-cognition model, we use language and recall tasks to manipulate the salience of participants’ cultural considerations: individualistic versus collectivistic. After the treatment, participants are exposed to negative and positive televised news reports and static images while we use biosensors to track participants’ psychophysiological activation (via skin conductance). A negativity bias is indicated by stronger physiological arousal during negative material. Analyses are performed at three levels of aggregation – respondent-as-a-case, stimuli-as-a-case, and second-by-second time-series. We expect that participants assigned to the collectivistic priming condition will exhibit less negativity bias compared to those assigned to the individualistic treatment condition.
