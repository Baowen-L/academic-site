  <summary><strong>Linguistic cleavages in public opinion</strong>  
</summary>

Linguistic diversity is a feature of many democratic countries. In a more limited 
number of cases, however, language constitutes a social and political cleavage. Given 
the importance of language in nation-building, such divides often go hand in hand 
with the linguistic minority calling for independence. But how important is the role 
of language, and does it extend beyond a connection with attitudes and opinions 
directly linked with the rights and claims to self-governance of different linguistic 
groups? This chapter first offers an overview of earlier work on language as an indicator 
of social and political differences. In a second section, the chapter zooms in on the 
dividing role of language in public opinion in Belgium and Canada.

  <summary><strong>2017年法国总统大选及政治生态的思考</strong> 
</summary>

From 1970 to 2018, either the Québec Liberal Party or the Parti Québécois won the elections in Québec. The Coalition Avenir Québec ended this long period of bipartisan alternation by winning a majority of seats in the 2018 election. Using datasets that cover five elections (2007, 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2018) over a period of 11 years, we provide a unique longitudinal perspective of citizens’ vote choice calculus. More specifically, we analyse long-term factors that are known to be crucial to make sense of electoral outcomes. Do factors such as generations, sex, attitudes towards Québec sovereignty and party identification have the same weight in voters’ calculus over time? Our results show a relative stability, but also several interesting variations, especially regarding the effect of support for Québec independence. This perspective deepens our understanding of recent political developments in Québec politics.
