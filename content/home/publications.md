  <summary><strong>More ‘Europe’, Less Democracy? European Integration Does Not Erode Satisfaction with Democracy</strong>  
</summary>

The process of European integration, through institutions such as the European
Union, the Eurozone, or Schengen, implies a shift in political decision-making
away from the national governments and towards international institutions. This
gradual shift in the balance of power, furthermore, is increasingly debated by
citizens. As a result, European integration might lead to an erosion of satisfaction
with democracy in European countries. By means of a longitudinal analysis of the
determinants of satisfaction with democracy in European countries, we test this
expectation. We find no indication that the shift in the balance of power, and the
trend towards more European integration indeed have eroded satisfaction with the
functioning of (national) democracy.

  <summary><strong>An extraordinary election? A longitudinal perspective of the Québec 2018 election</strong> 
</summary>

From 1970 to 2018, either the Québec Liberal Party or the Parti Québécois won the elections in Québec. The Coalition Avenir Québec ended this long period of bipartisan alternation by winning a majority of seats in the 2018 election. Using datasets that cover five elections (2007, 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2018) over a period of 11 years, we provide a unique longitudinal perspective of citizens’ vote choice calculus. More specifically, we analyse long-term factors that are known to be crucial to make sense of electoral outcomes. Do factors such as generations, sex, attitudes towards Québec sovereignty and party identification have the same weight in voters’ calculus over time? Our results show a relative stability, but also several interesting variations, especially regarding the effect of support for Québec independence. This perspective deepens our understanding of recent political developments in Québec politics.
