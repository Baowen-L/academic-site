In April 2024, I successfully defended my doctoral dissertation at the Université de Montréal and earned the highest distinction of “Exceptional”. I will soon begin my postdoctoral fellowship at the Université du Québec à Montréal, working with Professor Allison Harell.

I do research at the intersection of political science and psychology. I am interested in understanding how culture can shape citizens' political attitudes and behavior, with a regional focus on Greater China. My PhD dissertation investigates the influence of Confucianism on negativity biases and gender gaps in political participation.

I am currently a research fellow at the [Canada Research Chair in Electoral Democracy](https://www.chairedemocratie.com) led by Ruth Dassonneville and affiliated with the [Center for the Study of Democratic Citizenship](https://csdc-cecd.ca).
