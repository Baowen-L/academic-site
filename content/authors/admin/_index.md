I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at the University of Montreal (Canada). During my PhD, I have been a Visiting Researcher at the Department of Political Science at Aarhus University. I am funded by the [Fond de recherche du Québec Société et Culture (FRQSC)](http://www.frqsc.gouv.qc.ca/en/). 

Starting in the fall of 2023, I will be a Max Weber Fellow at the European University Institute.

I do research at the intersection of political opinion, geography and economy. I am also interested in questions on political behavior, group identity, and the political consequences of housing market. Methodologically, I have a keen interest for causal inference, experimental methods in social sciences and smart identification strategies. 

I am currently a research fellow at the [Canada Research Chair in Electoral Democracy](https://www.chairedemocratie.com) led by Ruth Dassonneville and affiliated with the [Center for the Study of Democratic Citizenship](https://csdc-cecd.ca). I am also a catalyst of the [Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences](https://www.bitss.org).
